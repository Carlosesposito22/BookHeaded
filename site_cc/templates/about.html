        <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
        <br>
        <p> With the ongoing advance of technology, we noticed that the book culture went on a skyhill down.<br><br>Such a
            mistake made <a>our team</a> think: "Why don't we ally this book thing with the internet?", and then,
            bookheaded
            was born.<br><br>
            Our goal is to make reading books entertaining again, by creating the perfect network for people to manage
            their
            book clubs, and make it easier to immerge into this culture. You can also interact with other enthusiasts,
            discuss your readings, make friends with similar tastes as you, and much more.
